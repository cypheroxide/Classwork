# Classwork
This is just a repository for my coding class scripts and code.  This is meant more as a testament to my growth and a record of my instruction and skill building.
This Repository will hold all of my PowerShell, Python, Bash, or whatever language scripts.

Some of these scripts were created as part of homework for coding/scripting classes in my Cybersecurity Program, some will be creations as part of mini projects.
I recommend checking out my other scripts, and maybe follow me as I continue to progress through my journey of what I affectionately call "Newb to 733T".  I also
manage a part time, rarely updated blog.  Feel free to check it out if want some lite reading and get a glimpse of my mind and its unruly chaotic neutral mess.

I can't promise that all of these scripts will work out of the box. I did create some of them with my computer in mind only, and I run rolling editions of Linux
and mulitple versions of Windows 7, 10, and Server 2019 that use some of these scripts or are written and tested on either my bare-metal OSes, or in a VM or two.
